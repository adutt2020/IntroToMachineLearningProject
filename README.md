## Sprint 7 - Intro To Machine Learning
**Project Summary:** Refined a classification model aimed at recommending new mobile plans to subscribers by leveraging early machine learning techniques.
**Technical Skills:** Machine learning fundamentals, classification algorithms, model training, and evaluation (using libraries like Scikit-learn).

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 
I have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since youâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model.

# Intro To Machine Learning Project
## Sprint 7 - Intro To Machine Learning
**Project Summary:** Refined a classification model aimed at recommending new mobile plans to subscribers by leveraging early machine learning techniques.
**Technical Skills:** Machine learning fundamentals, classification algorithms, model training, and evaluation (using libraries like Scikit-learn).

## Project Description

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 

I have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, I will need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. 

I will develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.  

## Conclusion
After evaluating multiple models, including the decision tree and random forest, it is determined that the random forest model outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. This chosen model demonstrates good predictive performance and passes the sanity check process. Overall, it provides reliable predictions with a high level of accuracy.

Based on my analysis and the performance of the chosen random forest model, my recommendation for Megaline would be to utilize this model to make package recommendations for their customers. The random forest model has demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting customer preferences between the Smart and Ultra packages.

By leveraging this model, Megaline can effectively analyze customer behavior and recommend the appropriate package to customers who have not yet switched to the latest package. This approach will enable Megaline to optimize their offerings and cater to individual customer needs, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and potentially higher subscription rates for the recommended package.
